# quartr

a quart template repo

## What is it?

It takes a fair bit of boilerplate to spin up any new project. I wanted to have
a repo I could clone for [Quart](https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/) 
projects as a starting point.

Some of the things this repo has to offer:

* A Quart "Hello World"-style app as a starting point
* A linting/test suite for this app with 100% coverage and no warnings
* A Dockerfile for containerizing the app
* A basic [Makefile](./Makefile) with helpful build targets for local dev

For some of the things I _want_ this repo to have, take a peek at
[TODO.md](./TODO.md).
