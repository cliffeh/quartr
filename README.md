# quartr

a quart template repo

## What is it?

It takes a fair bit of boilerplate to spin up any new project. I wanted to have
a repo I could clone for [Quart](https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/) 
projects as a starting point.

Some of the things I want this repo to have:

* A Quart "Hello World"-style app as a starting point
* A strict linting/test suite for this app, with 100% coverage and no warnings [WIP]
* A Dockerfile for containerizing the app
* A basic [Makefile](./Makefile) with helpful build targets for local dev
